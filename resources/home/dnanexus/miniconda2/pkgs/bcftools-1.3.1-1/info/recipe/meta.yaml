    summary: BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant
        Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work transparently
        with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.  Most commands
        accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected automatically even
        when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will work in all situations.
        Un-indexed VCF and BCF and streams will work in most, but not all situations.
