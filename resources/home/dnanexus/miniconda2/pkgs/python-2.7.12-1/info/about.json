  "description": "Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic\nprogramming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code\nreadability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in\nfewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or\nJava. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs\non both a small and large scale.\n",
